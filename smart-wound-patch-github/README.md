# Smart Wound Patch Monitor

A React-based application for monitoring smart wound patches via Bluetooth. This science project demonstrates how technology can be used to monitor wound healing and detect potential infections early.

## Features

- Real-time temperature monitoring
- Patch color change tracking
- Historical data visualization
- Temperature trend analysis
- QR code generation for sharing data
- Alert system for elevated temperatures

## Technologies Used

- React
- Web Bluetooth API
- Chart.js for data visualization
- QR code generation

## How to Use

1. Open the application in Chrome or Edge browser
2. Click "Connect to Device" to pair with a smart wound patch
3. View real-time temperature readings
4. Check color changes in the patch
5. Analyze historical data in the chart
6. Generate QR codes to share monitoring data

## Science Project Context

This application demonstrates how technology can be integrated with healthcare monitoring to provide:
- Early detection of wound infections through temperature monitoring
- Visual data representation for easier interpretation
- Remote monitoring capabilities
- Historical data tracking for pattern analysis

## Browser Compatibility

This application uses the Web Bluetooth API, which is supported in:
- Chrome (desktop and Android)
- Edge
- Opera
- Some Chromium-based browsers

**Note:** Safari and Firefox do not currently support Web Bluetooth API.
